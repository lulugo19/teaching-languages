Install [pyret](https://www.pyret.org/set-sail/)

You need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to be installed and then install the pyret package:
```
npm install -g pyret-npm
```
Add the the directory where the global npm modules are stored to your path. On Windows this is: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules`

Now you can execute `pyret` on your command line.
